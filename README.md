# Dat-Way
This is a project my team (Josiah Parappally, Sam Yu, and Tony Wang) and I worked on at Starterhacks 2019. Dat Way is an iOS application that was created using Swift 4 and MapKit, XCode, and the Apple Maps API. We used Map Kits to connect to the phone's Gyroscope and given a user's preferences for the type of entities they wanted to see, and the distance that they wanted to travel returned all entities that matched the user's search in the direction the point was pointing. Which way? Dat way!
